## Introduction

This repository showcases the data science projects I've worked on, ranging from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to predictive modeling using machine learning algorithms. Each project includes the dataset, analysis, and models I created, along with explanations and visualizations where applicable.


## Technologies Used

This repository contains code written in Python and makes use of the following libraries and tools:

- **Python:** The programming language used for all projects.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning models and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** For deep learning projects.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** For interactive development and analysis.

## Installation Instructions

To use or replicate any of the projects in this repository, you can clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SahanaKMurthy/Data_Science_Projects.git
cd Data_Science_Projects
```

### Install Dependencies:
You can install the necessary libraries using `pip` or `conda`.

1. Using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Using `conda` (if you have an Anaconda environment):
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

### Running the Notebooks:
To run the Jupyter Notebooks, activate your environment and launch Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then open any `.ipynb` file and start exploring!

## Usage

For each project, follow the instructions within the corresponding notebook to reproduce the analysis, models, and results. The notebooks are organized in a way to help you follow the workflow, from data cleaning to model evaluation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas to improve the projects, feel free to:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
